# Intro
Hi! I'm James McManus, a Computer Science and Game Development student at Northeastern University. This is my WIP portfolio, mostly for my game development and design work. I will be updating this website relatively frequently to showcase any new work I've created, or to better highlight my current work.

## Yan's Judgement

Yan, a shepherd of souls, finds a soul that missed the ferry for judgement, and must guide them across Heaven and Hell and through the entities that reside there to The Gate for their final judgement. Created with a team of 8 during the Boston Global Game Jam 2022. I was one of two programmers on the team, so it was a little tough getting everything into the game in the 48 hours we had, but it was a lot of fun. My whole team was amazing, but I think the music and art team especially knocked it out of the park, and I'm really happy with how the game turned out!

Bartholomew the Fourth has been abandoned by his mommy at the checkout counter. Will he wait the 23 seconds for his mom to come back (nudge,nudge, wink wink) or journey through the unknown aisles of the grocery store to find her? Can you find the secret ending? Created for the McGameJam 2022 as a part of a team of 4, with music by Luka Berman--[check out some of his work](https://soundcloud.com/hairband-truman-623680010). In line with Yan's judgement, I was again one of two programmers tasked with making the game in a short 48 hours, so it's pretty small in scope. It's a simple game but it was fun leaning into the silly theme, really enjoyed working on this and super proud of what our small team created in the time we had.

A bunch of angry melons fell on Bartholomew's head during the filming of this segment. No melons nor Bartholomews were harmed in the making of this game.





## Spaceship FPS
[Itch.io Link](https://mcmanusj.itch.io/mca4)

Engage enemy ships that are raiding space stations around planets in our solar system. Fight them off with your ship's fast-firing lasers and slow but powerful missiles, and defend the space stations. This was an individual project created for my Game Programming class, and mainly showcases the basics of Unity that I've learned over the semester. Enemies either charge straight towards the player or are controlled by a simple Finite State Machine (FSM), which switches between patrolling, chasing, and attacking states based on line of sight and proximity to the player.

Side note: you can probably tell from the pictures, but the planets are not quite in the right spot or the right size, but they are to scale relative to each other (Jupiter is very far away).


## Cool Game (Bullet Hell Endless Scroller) 
[Itch.io Link](https://bejules.itch.io/cool-game).

Group project created for my Game Programming class. Everything except assets and animations were written and made from scratch. I edited the trailer from a teammates' playthrough of the game.

Ignore the 'Dragon Quest' at the end of the trailer, we still haven't decided on a name :)

A Screenshot from the first level of the game. Player is the green character in the bottom middle, and the camera slowly moves upwards as enemies spawn along constantly generating terrain. As the player defeats enemies, they gain experience and levels, which can be spent in the shop shown in the next picture.

The shop is accessable by beating the boss at the end of a level or dying, and it contains permanent upgrades for the player, including new spells, movement speed, damage reduction, etc.

The first boss in the game, the Goblin King. The boss switches between two phases on a timer. In both phases, the boss runs back and forth along the top of the platform. In the first phase, the boss fires a projectile directly downwards periodically. After a certain amount of time, the boss will switch to the other phase. In this phase, if the player is in line-of-sight of the boss (i.e. directly below the boss), the boss will charge forward quickly. After a certain amount of time, the boss switches back to the original phase.

Phase 1- Boss fires projectiles downwards.

Phase 2- Boss is charging at the player, dealing damage on contact.

The second boss in the game, the Skeleton King. The Boss similarly switched between phases, this time switching between firing tracking projectiles (which were introduced in the same level as the boss), high damage fireball spells, and summoning skeleton minions that charge and attack you in melee. 

Phase 2 - Boss fires slow-moving, high damage fireball projectiles towards the player.
![Image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/475503547656568842/895912992758202388/unknown.png)

Phase 3 - Boss stays in place, stops firing projectiles, and spawns skeleton minions that attack you.

Last but very much not least, we have the final boss, the Dragon. It is a 4 (and a half) phase boss that tests the skills that the player has cultivated over their journey. It is highly mobile, and dishes out a lot of damage very quickly to underprepared wizards. Players that have invested many of their skill points into movement and defensive spells will find the fight to be easier than those who underestimated the dragon. It starts with a simple move-and-shoot phase, but quickly picks up the pace with a wide spread of rapidly-firing fireballs that force the player to duck between the gaps.

Phase 2 - Dragon fires a rapid-fire spread of fireballs.

Immediately following this phase, the dragon unleashes a repeated shotgun-blast volley of fireballs, constantly turning towards the player. This is where movement speed is especially helpful for the player to invest their skill points into.

Phase 3 - Dragon fires targeted shotgun blast of fireballs towards the player.
![Image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/475503547656568842/895916135512412250/unknown.png)


After this, the dragon takes to the skies, raining firey death from above. A constant stream of fireballs shot directly towards the player again encourages movement upgrades for the player, but is entirely avoidable without any if the player is good enough at dodging. The dragon swoops low in the middle, allowing for counterattack as well.

Phase 4 - Dragon takes off and fires an arial barrage of fire towards the player.
![Image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/475503547656568842/895916276801765376/unknown.png)


Greatly exhausting its energy from flying and attacking simultaneously, the dragon lands and once again moves around the stage, but barely fires off any shots, giving the player a chance to deal as much damage as possible in this vulnerability window. Then, the fight repeats until a victor emerges. 



## FPS Phase-Shifting Mechanic Showcase Level
[Itch.io Link](https://mcmanusj.itch.io/phasechange).

This level is a showcase of a mechanic I came up with based on a game design pattern a classmate had created. The [design pattern](https://patternlanguageforgamedesign.com/PatternLibraryApp/PatternLibrary/442) talked about how the core shooting mechanics of most shooter games are relatively stale, and how designers need to change the way players utilize shooting to make shooting an interesting mechanic. I came up with the idea that whenever the player shoots, the world switches phases, denoted by Blue and Orange objects for each phase. Only one phase can be active at a time, so whenever the player shoots while blue objects are visible, the blue objects disappear and the orange objects appear. As the level progresses, more things become tied to phases, and the player has to think about their position and crosshair placement to 'defeat' all of the enemies (capsules) in the level. The level is a simple showcase of the mechanic, so the demo is focused more on that and lacks general polish.
