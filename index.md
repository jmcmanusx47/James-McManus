### FPS Phase-Shifting Mechanic Showcase Level
This level is a showcase of a mechanic that I came up with based on a game design pattern a classmate had created. It talked about how the core shooting mechanics of most shooter games are relatively stale, and how designers need to change the way players utilize shooting to make it interesting. I came up with the idea that whenever the player shoots, the world switches phases, denoted by Blue and Orange objects for each phase. Only one phase can be active at a time, so whenever the player shoots while blue objects are visible, the blue objects disappear and the orange objects appear. As the level progresses, more things become tied to phases, and the player has to think about their position and crosshair placement to 'defeat' all of the enemies (capsules) in the level. The level is a simple showcase of the mechanic, so the demo is focused more on that and lacks general polish.

Player fires a shot from the same spot as the previous picture, switching the phase to orange, changing the geometry of the level. ![Image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/803364518818349116/815702667169890314/unknown.png)
