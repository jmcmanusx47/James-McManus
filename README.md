# Hello!


Hey, I'm James McManus, a Computer Science and Game Development student at Northeastern University. This is my WIP portfolio, mostly for my game development work. If you're here, you're probably looking for the more formatted website here: https://jmcmanusx47.github.io/James-McManus/. Thanks for taking a look :)
